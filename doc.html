	   <h1> Dodge-the-Pokeball</h1>

	       <p>
		I used Leap Motion and aframe to create this game. The concept is that you are a pokemon that is trying to dodge pokeballs that are flying toward you. Users must use two hands to steer themselves left and right (Credit: Move in VR, Kapp Craig) to avoid being hit by pokeballs. 

	       This was built as a component of my final project. The only difference is that my final project does not involve steering.
